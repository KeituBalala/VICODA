<h1>Reflection: Ethical Reflection On Risky Technologies</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/09/22"> Posted Tuesday, 22 September</time>

<p>In this blog post, I will be reflecting on Sabine Roeser's <cite>'How Art Can Contribute to Ethical Reflection on Risky Technologies'</cite>. 
  I evaluate the scholar's research problem, identify the aim of the article, as well as how the scholar achieves it. Furthermore, I reflect on 
  the main arguments presented and evaluate the findings. </p>

<p>Roeser begins by emphasizing that <cite>“Debates about technological risks are highly complicated as they involve scientific and moral 
  uncertainties and complexities.”</cite> (Roeser, 2016:127). As a result, she suggests that the use of visual arts and literature amongst 
  other strategies is needed to conduct the debates, to reduce the uncertainties and complexities. (Roeser, 2016:127). With that being said, 
  Roeser introduces her aim for the article, stating that “In this essay, I will examine the contribution that art can make to improve 
  deliberation concerning technological risks by engaging people in emotional -moral reflection”(Roeser, 2016:127). To achieve this, Roeser 
  discusses the various aspects of techno-art including the precursors of contemporary techno-art, techno-Art, and emotional-moral reflection 
  about risk, as well as, techno-art and public deliberation. </p>

<p>In her discussion of techno-art, Roeser begins by establishing that new technology is often seen as risky, however, artists are often 
  interested in these technologies and find ways to incorporate them into their creative process, which highlights the definition of techno-art. 
  Roeser defines techno-art as <cite>“art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies.”</cite>(Roeser, 2016:127).</p>

<p>Reflecting on the precursors of contemporary techno-art, Roeser demonstrates that many artists have engaged with scientific and technological 
  developments, including Leonardo da Vinci as one of the most famous. Furthermore, she highlights that <cite>“Science fiction is a 
    well-established genre in literature and film dealing with utopian as well as dystopian visions of technological developments and their 
    possible impacts on society, probing ethical reflection with aesthetic means and via the imaginative emotional capacities of the audience.”</cite> (Roeser, 2016:127). 
    In this, Roeser demonstrates that science fiction has provided audiences with a glimpse into the possible consequences technological advances 
    could bring, in this being a precursor of techno-art. </p>

<p>In her discussion regarding contemporary techno-art, Roeser reflects on bio-art, robotics-art, and ICT-art. She recalls how Stelar, a 
  performance artist <cite>“Experimented with his own body by attaching a third ear to his arm by surgery and cell-cultivation, partially 
    using his stem cells.”</cite>(Roeser, 2016:128). In doing this Stelar explores the technological and scientific possibilities and their 
    legal and ethical boundaries.</p>

<p>In his article <cite> 'The work of art in the age of post-mechanical reproduction' </cite> Roger Malinga addresses the idea of technology as 
  an extension of the human and an opportunity for new forms of art. Malina states that <cite>"The first purpose of technology is its use to 
    extend or expand our information collecting systems; that is, our senses."</cite> (Malina, 1990:36). His analysis of technology as an 
    extension of man, emphasizes the opportunities that the collaboration may bring, which has invited debate surrounding the ethical concerns of 
    the matter. </p>

<p>Roeser advances that techno-art can invite debate and reflection on the risks of new technologies, she emphasizes this by stating that 
  <cite>“techno-art can reach out to people in a very direct way, by drawing on their imaginative and emotional capacities.”</cite>(Roeser, 2016:128). 
  Furthermore, she demonstrates that <cite>“Techno-artists can create awareness of societal issues, and provide critical reflection on 
    technological and scientific developments”<cite> (Roeser, 2016:128). Roeser supports this by establishing her philosophical standpoint, 
      being that art can assist us in our ethical and political thinking (Roeser, 2016:128). </p>

<p>Roeser emphasizes that techno-art can provide direct experience with new technologies through which emotional-moral reflection can be 
  encouraged and investigated, as a result, she believes that this allows for Techno-art to play a <cite>“powerful role in public deliberation.”</cite> (Roeser, 2016:129). 
  She demonstrates that by <cite>“making climate change more salient, inciting people to take actions.”</cite> (Roeser, 2016:129), 
  the works of techno-art can play a vital role in debates about sustainable-energy technologies.</p>

<p>Although techno-art cannot provide clear-cut answers regarding ethical and moral consideration of new technologies, she advances that they do 
  provide a <cite>“common platform for reflection where different kinds of stakeholders can deliberate together on equal footing”</cite>(Roeser, 2016:129), 
  this being because, as Roeser states, work of arts can ensure that complex scientific developments are concrete and tangible for larger audiences.</p>

<p>In her final reflection on Techno-Art and public deliberation, Roeser highlights that techno-art can contribute to overcoming what is known as 
  the <cite>“Collingridge dilemma” </cite>(Roeser, 2016:130). This dilemma is whereby the possible detrimental effects of technologies can only 
  be adequately and entirely understood when the technology is used by the entire society. From my understanding, techno-art and other forms of 
  technology-based art address this dilemma through artists using these new technologies and therefore allowing for the effects to be discovered 
  and explored earlier allowing for improvements and alternatives to be created before the new technology is introduced to society at large.</p>

<p>Despite providing many opportunities, Roeser highlights that techno-art does experience some challenges. She states that because it may, often, 
  be difficult for the audience or society to grasp a certain artwork, it is possible that the techno-art not achieve its objective in contributing 
  to public debates, by emphasizing implications, emotions as well as values related to new technology. However, the main challenge is that 
  <cite>“it can be difficult to ensure that artists have the freedom to pursue their ideas, while at the same time making a meaningful 
    contribution to ethical reflection and doing justice to scientific and legal constraints”</cite>(Roeser, 2016:130)</p>

<p>In concluding her argument, Roeser reflects on the promises of techno-art stating that <cite>“Techno-art is a rapidly expanding field of artistic development that could potentially make a major contribution to society, but which also requires thorough investigations by philosophers and other scholars.”</cite>(Roeser, 2016:130). Based on the arguments presented in the article, I was able to identify and advance Roeser’s thesis. Which is that <cite>“Art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies, i.e ‘techno-art’, can make abstract problems 
    more concrete, aid in the exploration of new scenarios, challenge the imagination, and broaden narrow personal perspectives through empathy, 
    sympathy, and compassion.”</cite>(Roeser, 2016:127). That being said, despite all the challenges that techno-art still faces, the work of 
    art can encourage reflection on risky technologies.</p>
