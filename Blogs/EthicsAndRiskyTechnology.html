<h1>Reflection: Ethical Reflection On Risky Technologies</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/07/28"> Posted Tuesday, 28 July</time>

<p>In this blog post I will be reflecting on Jenny Kidd’s ‘Theories of representation’. I will analyse the key arguments presented, 
  the theoretical orientation, identify the proposed thesis in the article, and evaluate my findings.</p>

<p>In her article, Kidd begins by acknowledging that there have been many debates surrounding the topic of representation, many of which 
  have contributed to complicating the concept. Through her article, she aims to demonstrate that <cite>“Representation is no 
    straightforward window on the world”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:19). Kidd achieves this by making use of case analysis to support her key 
    arguments. Kidd reflects on representation in five key points of discussion. These points being representation and reality; 
    representation and myth; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; and representation and identity politics. 
    Kidd’s identified theoretical standpoint is about Jen Webb’s statement (Webb, 2009:3) in that <cite>“we live immersed in representation: 
      it is how we understand our environments and each other. It is also how we both are, and how we understand ourselves; representation 
      is implicated in the process of me becoming me.”<cite>. In this, Webb demonstrates the importance of representation in contributing 
        to the configuration of concepts of selfhood, social encounters, and embodiment.</p>

<p> Within her discussion of representation and reality, Kidd begins by establishing that media and cultural texts make use of signs and 
  codes to form reality, furthermore, that this reality then<cite>” features a brief sojourn into semiology”</cite>(Kidd, 2015:19). 
  In reference to the texts used to form reality, Kidd reflects on Daniel Chandler in stating that <cite>“texts can be any ‘assemblage 
    of signs’” (Kidd, 2015:19).</cite> This statement asserts that text is not limited to written text rather any collection of code and 
    symbols that formulate a form of representation and thus reality. Expanding further on the concepts of representation and reality, 
    Kidd asserts that our ideas of reality are formed through text and language, as opposed to <cite> "reality existing before language 
      gives word to it” (Kidd, 2015:20). </cite> </p>

<p>Notably, Kidd advances that in themselves signs don’t have meaning, but rather obtain their meaning <cite> "by virtue of its difference 
  from all other signs.” (Kidd, 2015:21). To this end, I begin to fully recognize how the assemblage of signs and codes can produce meaning 
  in a text, that ultimately leads to the formulation of reality.</p>

<p> Although giving meaning to texts that formulate reality, in her discussion about representation and myth, Kidd establishes that semiotics 
  have denotative and connotative associations. In my understanding, I was able to interpret that in the denotative context, the signs and 
  codes closely reflect reality. However, in the connotative context, signs, and codes reflect a reality that is based on, often subjective, 
  perceptions. The impact of the subjectivity associated with connotations of text, is further reflected in Kidd’s assertion (Kidd, 2015:24) 
  in that <cite> “the bringing together of signs and their connotations”</cite>, result in, <cite>“the making of ‘myth’”</cite></p>

<p> In evaluating Kidd’s analysis of representation and myth, I noticed the ambiguity of signs and codes in text. However, in her discussion 
  of representation and visual communication, she demonstrates that <cite> “visual communication can be understood as more ambiguous, 
    suggestive and open to multiple interpretations than other forms of communication.” (Kidd, 2015:26). Visual communication can be 
    presented in various formats. Each of the formats which they are presented on influences how visual communication is interpreted.</p>

<p> In today’s digital society there are many modes through which visual communication can be presented, increasing the number of ways that 
  it can be interpreted. Kidd reflects on Walter Benjamin in emphasizing that, with the various modes through which visual communication can 
  be presented, there has been a subsequent impact on the aura of content. In Benjamin’s words, Kidd asserts that <cite>“Even the most perfect 
    reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element; its presence in time and space its unique existence at the place where it happens 
    to be”</cite> (Benjamin, 1955:29). In other words, with the reproductions of various visual communications, the aura of each communication 
    has changed or been entirely lost. I have come to understand, through studying Benjamin’s article, that the aura of artwork or a form of 
    visual communication can contribute to how individuals perceive the artwork or visual communication. Therefore, in a time of mass 
    reproduction, when visual communication elements lose their aura, individuals can misinterpret the message</p>

<p>In her discussion about representation as persuasion, Kidd reflects on how consumers can be convinced and persuaded through how we 
  perceive and interpret that which has been presented to us. In stating that, <cite> “it is in more subtle ways that advertising seduces us; 
    through association, often unspoken, just hinted at, and we as consumers fill in the rest.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:33), Kidd demonstrates how 
    through minor indications in how content is presented, that stimulates consumer perceptions, and thus, influences buying decisions. 
    Representation acts as a basis for persuasion. </p> 

<p> The opportunity for ambiguity and persuasion in representation leads us to consider the possible political concerns related to 
  representation. T provide clarity on the political standpoint of the discussion Kidd clarifies by stating that <cite> “to say something 
    is political is to note that it can never be neutral or a-historical, even when it might appear to be ambivalent.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:37). 
    One of the main reasons why representation can be political is because it is ever-changing and is open for interpretation. 
    Through this, there is an indication as to how the outcome and possible power dynamics created by representation, can be intense. 
    Kidd asserts this in her statement that representations can <cite>“become battlegrounds for struggles over meaning within society, 
      over what is deemed acceptable, what is unsayable, what is punishable.”</cite> (Kidd’ 2015:39). </p>

<p>In reading and reflecting on the theories of representation, I was able to interpret how broad the concept of representation is, moreover, 
how it is a vital part of human embodiment. Representation is a large part of how we perceive reality, similarly our perceptions and 
interpretations of reality and how it is being presented breeds opportunity for myth. Throughout human history, visual communication 
has been a part of human interaction, and in it, leaving even more ambiguity in meaning and thus understanding. With that being said, 
there have been various uses of visual communication for persuasion causing one to reflect on the politics of representation.  
Through this article, Kidd has adequately advanced her thesis, in that, <cite>“representation is constructive, resilient, and implicated 
  in the forging of identities, cultures, communities and in the articulation of difference.” </cite>(Kidd, 2015:19).</p>
