      <h1>Exam Reflection: Simple But Significant Pie Chart</h1>
      
      <time datetime=" 2020/11/25"> Posted Wednesday, 25 November</time>
      
      <p>In this blog post, I will be reflecting on my ‘simple but significant’ pie chart. I make use of Jenny Kidd's article <cite>'Theories of 
        representation'</cite>, as well as Richie et al’s ‘Communicating data to an audience’ as theoretical standpoints to analyze the 
        representation and communication strategies I have used in my graph. I will then discuss the aim of the chart, as well as how I have 
        incorporated interactivity and meaning into it.</p>

<p>According to Oxford, a pie chart is a type of graph in which a circle is divided into sectors that each represent a proportion of the whole. 
  The disadvantage of pie charts is that they can be easily manipulated to yield false impressions, as well as, fail to reveal key assumptions, 
  causes, effects, or patterns.</p>

<p>I chose to use a pie chart for demonstrating my data because not only is it visually simpler than other types of graphs, but it requires 
  minimal additional explanation to the chart itself and it is easily understood due to widespread use in business and the media. Despite the 
  shortfalls, the pie chart permits <cite>“a visual check of the reasonableness or accuracy of calculations”</cite>(Barcelona Field Studies 
  Centre 2020). In that, It is very easy for users to better compare data sets, as well as, for data artists to check the accuracy of their 
  proportions and comparisons they wish to communicate. </p>

<p>In her article, Kidd refers to Jen Webb’s statement (Webb, 2009:3) that <cite>“we live immersed in representation: it is how we understand 
  our environments and each other. It is also how we both are, and how we understand ourselves; representation is implicated in the process of
   me becoming me.”</cite>. In this, Webb demonstrates the importance of representation in contributing to the configuration of concepts of 
   selfhood, social encounters, and embodiment.</p>

<p>The data that I have chosen addresses the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases, whereby the individual was infected in a hospital. 
  Besides being similar to the data that Florence Nightingale aimed to address, I found this data important to communicate due to the 
  relevance and risk it bears. In communicating the data to an audience, I influence their perceptions of and how they should act in hospitals. 
  This reflects what Kidd was demonstrating regarding representation and reality. </p>

<p>Kidd advances that in themselves signs don’t have meaning, but rather obtain their meaning <cite>"by virtue of its difference from all 
  other signs.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:21). This is reflected in my data visualization, in that, alone the number of people infected due to 
  hospital negligence may not seem alarming. However, based on coronavirus updates and reports, the virus is likely to lead to death if 
  the infected persons have a pre-existing condition. This is alarming, as often people who need to go to the hospital are there to treat 
  their pre-existing conditions. Increasing the probability and thus negative results of them contracting the virus. In this context, 
  the number of hospital infections weighs more and emphasizes concern. I was able to communicate this concern through the data 
  visualisation video. By contrasting and comparing the data to the overall impacts it has as well as reflecting its proportion in
   relation to the new confirmed cases, I was able to demonstrate the meaning it brings through its comparison to other data sets and information. </p>

<p>In her discussion of representation and visual communication, Kidd demonstrates that <cite>“visual communication can be understood as 
  more ambiguous, suggestive and open to multiple interpretations than other forms of communication.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:26). 
  Visual communication can be presented in various formats. Each of the formats in which they have presented influences on how 
  visual communication is interpreted. </p>

<p>In today’s digital society there are many modes through which visual communication can be presented, increasing the number of ways that it 
  can be interpreted. I chose to incorporate a video as part of my data visualisation communication strategy. This is so as to further 
  explore other mediums as a form of communication, as well as to influence the data visualization interpretation 
  and ensure detailed understanding. </p>

<p>Kidd clarifies that <cite>“to say something is political is to note that it can never be neutral or a-historical, even when it might appear 
  to be ambivalent.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:37). The main factor that makes this data visualization political is that it challenges the safety 
  precautions that hospitals have put in place. It encourages people to question and analyze their engagements and encounters with and at 
  the hospitals. </p>

<p>According to Riche et al, an audience can have visual literacy and still struggle to interpret the information, moreover, they may 
  incorrectly interpret the information based on how it is presented. To this end, Riche et al introduce an ethical standpoint, in that, 
  it is the responsibility of the data artist to create visualisations that won’t skew or mislead the audience's interpretations. </p>

<p>One way that Riche et al suggest data artists avoid this, is through the use of annotations. Riche et al advance that <cite>“annotations 
  add explanations and descriptions to introduce the graph’s context, which is important for almost any audience (Hullman et al., 2013)”</cite> 
  (Riche et al., 2018:214). To make use of this communication strategy, I presented my annotations to the chart in video format, 
  this was also to ensure that the intended message of the chart was communicated in detail and accommodates all forms of literacy. </p>

<p>In their article Riche et al demonstrates that regardless of how well presented the data visualisation is, the audience's perceptions of the 
  data may change its intended meaning, hence the importance of understanding what they already know to better ensure the message of the 
  visualisation remains as accurate as possible. That to say, I took a risk in using a pie chart as the audience may interpret the data 
  to be insignificant, due to its simplistic presentation. I, however, chose a simple chart so as to ensure that the meaning and message 
  of the data can be understood by a variety of audiences due to the ubiquity of pie charts. </p>

<p>Riche et al advances that consistency in colours, fonts, and layout used in creating visualisations is one strategy that a data artist 
  can incorporate to ensure audience relatability and return. Riche et al refer to this as <cite>“visual branding”.</cite> 
  (Riche et al., 2018:219). In my pie chart, I have used the same fonts and colour schemes as all previous visualizations on the website. 
  This is to ensure that regardless of the graph an audience is engaging with, they have a basic understanding of what the message may be. </p>

<p>While reflecting on interactivity, Riche et al identified one of the innovative ways to encourage self-identification, being through
   directly engaging the audience, for example, by asking the audience questions. They assert that doing this can assist in engagement as 
   well as help the audience remember what they have seen. Unlike my donut chart, the interactivity of this chart is based on the audience 
   understanding the importance of the data in the visualization. So I encourage the audience to engage with articles and the data 
   visualization video to better interpret and understand why the chart is important. </p>

<p>The final key factor that Riche et al assert is that <cite>“despite its prevalence in popular culture, television as a medium is still 
  almost completely overlooked in visualization research”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:228). Although not being televised, I made use of the 
  video as part of the data visualization to explore the communication opportunities that video content present, especially in popular culture. </p>

<p>There are various design contexts and factors that I hoped to improve, as well as communicate through the visualisation. 
  However, due to struggling with various technical aspects, I aimed to keep the data visualization simple to avoid misleading the 
  audience through design. The pie chart being ubiquitous allows for it to be easily understandable given the amount of data to be interpreted. 
  There are, however, many ways that it can be visually improved to promote user engagement and curiosity. Regardless, I assert the 
  importance of the data and advance that more research is conducted so the data can form part of what is communicated to the public, 
  so they are fully aware of all the risks they face. </p>
