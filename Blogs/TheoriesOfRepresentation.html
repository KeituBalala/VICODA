<h1>Reflection: Theories Of Representation</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/07/28"> Posted Tuesday, 28 July</time>

<p>In this blog post I will be analysing Jenny Kidd’s ‘Theories of representation’. I will be reflecting on the key arguments presented, 
  the theoretical orientation, identify the proposed thesis in the article, and evaluate my findings.</p>

<p>In her article, Kidd begins by acknowledging that there have been many debates surrounding the topic of representation, many of which 
  have contributed to complicating the concept. Through her article she aims to demonstrate that “Representation is no straightforward 
  window on the world” (Kidd, 2015:19). Furthermore, Kidd advances her thesis in that <cite>“representation is constructive, resilient, 
    and implicated in the forging of identities, cultures, communities and in the articulation of difference.” </cite>(Kidd, 2015:19).</p>

<p> Through the use of case analysis to support her key arguments, Kidd reflects on representation in five main points of discussion. 
  These points being representation and reality; representation and myth; representation and visual culture; representation as persuasion; 
  and representation and identity politics. Kidd’s identified theoretical standpoint is in reference to Jen Webb’s statement (Webb, 2009:3) 
  in that <cite>“we live immersed in representation: it is how we understand our environments and each other. It is also how we both are , 
    and how we understand ourselves; representation is implicated in the process of me becoming me.”<cite>. In this, Webb demonstrates the 
      importance of representation in contributing to the configuration of concepts of selfhood, social encounters and embodiment.</p>

<p> Within her discussion of representation and reality, Kidd begins by establishing that media and cultural texts make use of signs and 
  codes to form a reality, furthermore, that this reality then<cite>”features a brief sojourn into semiology”</cite>(Kidd, 2015:19). 
  In reference to the texts used to form reality, Kidd reflects on Daniel Chandler in stating that <cite>“texts can be any ‘assemblage 
    of signs’” (Kidd, 2015:19).</cite> This statements asserts that text is not limited to written text rather any collection of code and 
    symbols that formulate a form of representation and thus reality. Expanding further on the concepts of representation and reality, 
    Kidd asserts that our ideas of reality are formed through text and language, as opposed to <cite> "reality existing before language gives 
      word to it” (Kidd, 2015:20). </cite> </p>

<p>Notably, Kidd advances that in themselves signs don’t have meaning, but rather obtain their meaning <cite>”by virtue of its difference 
  from all other signs.” (Kidd, 2015:21). To this end, I begin to fully recognize how the assemblage of signs and codes are able to produce 
  meaning in text, that ultimately leads to the formulation of reality.</p>

<p> Although giving meaning to texts that formulate reality, in her discussion about representation and myth, Kidd establishes that semiotics 
  have a denotative and connotative associations. In my understanding, I was able to interpret that in the denotative context the signs and 
  codes closely reflect a reality. However, in connotative context signs and codes reflect a reality that is based on, often subjective, 
  perceptions. The impact of the subjectivity associated with connotations of text, is further reflected in Kidd’s assertion (Kidd, 2015:24) 
  in that <cite> “the bringing together of signs and their connotations”</cite>, result in, <cite>“the making of ‘myth’”</cite><p>

<p> In her discussion of representation and myth, Kidd begins to highlights the ambiguity of signs and codes in text. However, 
  in her discussion of representation and visual communication, she demonstrates that <cite> “visual communication can be understood 
    as more ambiguous, suggestive and open to multiple interpretations than other forms of communication.” (Kidd, 2015:26).</p>
