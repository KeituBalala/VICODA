<h1>Reflection: Communicating Data To An Audience</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/08/25"> Posted Tuesday, 25 August</time>

<p>In this blog post, I will be reflecting on chapter 9 from Nathalie Riche’s book ‘Data-Driven Storytelling’. 
  In her book, Riche collaborates with various scholars to discuss factors that largely impact and make up storytelling 
  through the use of data and information. In the chapter, Riche et al focus on establishing the vital consideration necessary
   to communicate data to an audience. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the chapter Riche et al begins by emphasizing that, to effectively communicate a story or narrative to an 
  audience, a data artist needs to have a basic understanding of the audience they’re targeting. However, they notes that 
  <cite>“a large audience will consist of people with different backgrounds and knowledge levels that are impossible to target 
    at the same time.” </cite>(Riche et al., 2018:212). In stating this, Riche et al indicate the research problem, which they 
    will be addressing in the chapter. </p>

<p>Obtaining an understanding of your audience allows one to better target their visualisation to an audience that will be able 
  to adequately interpret and understand the message that the visual is meant to portray. However, it is not always easy to gain 
  access to information regarding one’s target audience.  To that end, in this chapter Riche et al aims to 
  <cite>“explore design considerations relating to audience knowledge and goal contexts, and consider the difference between the 
    theory of what we might know and the reality of what we can know.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:213).</p>

<p>Overall Riche et al aims to assist and guide data artists in formulating well-designed data stories. They achieves this by 
  discussing some techniques that allow data artists to better tailor their visualisation to an audience they have limited information 
  about. Furthermore, they discusses distinct design contexts and their relevant factors.  Riche et al’s discussion is divided into 
  three main categories, this includes; what the audience knows, what the audience wants, as well as, specific design contexts</p>

<p>In reflecting on what the audience knows, Riche et al assert the importance of a data artist having an understanding of their 
  audience’s data visualisation literacy. They defines visualisation literacy as <cite>“the ability to interpret visual patterns 
    of the underlying data and to confidently use visualisation to answer questions about the data.” </cite>(Riche et al., 2018:214). </p>

<p>To put this another way, data and visualisation literacy is the ability to engage over the data represented. That said, an 
  audience can have visual literacy and still struggle to interpret the information, moreover, they may incorrectly 
  interpret the information based on how it is presented. To this end, Riche et al introduce an ethical standpoint, in that, it is 
  the responsibility of the data artist to create visualisations that won’t skew or mislead the audience's interpretations. 
  One way that Riche et al suggest data artists avoid this, is through the use of annotations. Riche et al advance that 
  <cite>“annotations add explanations and descriptions to introduce the graph’s context, which is important for almost any 
    audience (Hullman et al., 2013)”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:214). Whilst referring to a line chart that appeared in The 
    New York Daily Tribune, in 1849, as an example. Riche et al establish that by making use of explanatory caption and annotations, 
    the audience is guided in how to interpret and read the chart. </p>
 
<p>In their discussion about background knowledge and expertise, Riche et al assert that when making use of data storytelling the 
  data artist needs to consider the basic information and knowledge that the targeted audience is expected to have. This ties in 
  with understanding the audience data and visualisation literacy. It is, however, vital that the data artist understand that 
  <cite>“an individual in the audience brings their own viewpoints, backgrounds, and experience to each and every data-driven 
    story they consume.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:217). When reading this, I was able to reflect on Jenny Kidd’s 
    ‘Theories of representation’, in which they states that <cite> “visual communication can be understood as more ambiguous, 
      suggestive, and open to multiple interpretations than other forms of communication.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:26). As a result, 
      regardless of how well presented the data visualisation is the audience's perceptions of the data may change its intended 
      meaning, hence the importance of understanding what they already know to better ensure the message of the visualisation 
      remains as accurate as possible. </p>
 
<p>After reflecting on the background knowledge and expertise, Riche et al introduce the importance of understanding the targeted 
  audience’s design expectations. From my understanding, when understanding the audience’s design expectations, the data artists 
  are better able to communicate the information to the audience based on how they are expecting to receive the information. 
  Consistency in colours, fonts, and layout used in creating the visualisation is one strategy that a data artist can incorporate 
  to ensure audience relatability and return. Riche et al refer to this as <cite>“visual branding”.</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:219). </p>
 
<p>Understanding the audience's design expectations may act as a gateway to understanding what the audience wants. Riche et al 
  advance that <cite>“data stories are more impactful and useful when they are crafted with the motivations, goals, and tasks of 
    users in mind.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:220). Riche et al introduce their philosophical standpoint, in that, 
    <cite>“people receive certain gratifications from the media they consume that help satisfy various underlying social or 
      psychological needs.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:222). There are four main categories of what the audience may want and 
      their motivations for engaging with data visualisations. These being; to stay informed, gain insight into oneself or others, 
      to socially interact and connect with others, or as relaxing entertainment. </p>

<p>By the data artist understanding these motivations and reasons, they can better tailor the data visualisation to the audience, 
  as each audience would likely seek and expect a certain type of data visualisation. Riche et al provide more detail to this by 
  establishing that, for example, an individual seeking entertainment <cite>“might take more license with visual novelty and not 
    focus as closely on efficiency in decoding visual information.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:221). </p>

<p>By understanding what the targeted audience wants and providing them with it, The data artist can encourage audience self-identification 
  in the visualisation. Through innovative ways to achieve self-identification, it possible to tailor the data visualisation to the 
  audience without knowing it. Riche et al identify one of the innovative ways to encourage self-identification, being through directly 
  engaging the audience, for example, by asking the audience questions.  Riche et al that through doing this it can assist in engagement 
  as well as help the audience remember what they have seen. </p>

<p>The final key factor that Riche et al discuss, is specific design contexts. They emphasize that the mediums used to communicate and 
  present the data visuals to the audience are a vital part of what visual can be created as well as what users can expect. Once again, 
  this reflects on Kidd’s theories of representation, in that, in all the possible modes and formats that visual communication can be 
  presented, each format influences how visual communication is interpreted. Riche et al go on to demonstrate this by analysing newsrooms 
  and television for visualisation purposes. </p>
 
<p>Riche et al establish that television poses unique design challenges for data visualisation. Presenting issues such as; limited detail, 
  lack of interaction, as well as, television graphics often being three-dimensional. Regardless of the challenges, television offers many 
  data visualisation opportunities, however, as Riche et al assert <cite>“despite its prevalence in popular culture, television as a medium 
    is still almost completely overlooked in visualisation research” </cite>  (Riche et al., 2018:228). </p>

<p>In reading and reflecting on communicating data visualisation. I was able to establish that to ensure a smart design, data artists need 
  to take into account available information about their targeted audience, however, can create a well-designed story even if they lack all 
  the necessary audience information. Furthermore, I was able to understand and thus advances Riche et al’s thesis for the chapter, in that, 
  <cite>“A single-story cannot possibly address all possible different audiences and their needs. And any well-designed story will be 
    tailored not just to its data and the intended message, but to its audience.” </cite>  (Riche et al., 2018:212)</p>
