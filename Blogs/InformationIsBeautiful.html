<h1>Bonus Analysis: Information Is Beautiful</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/09/08"> Posted Tuesday, 8 September</time>

<p>In this blog post I will be analysing the ‘who old are you’ diagram, from the ‘information is beautiful' website. This is an interactive 
  scatter plot, that allows you to view the age or average age of various categories. Once you enter the website, you are asked to fill in 
  your age and they then plot your age on the diagram whereby you can compare to other age categories where you fall in or align. </p>

<p>Upon first encountering the chart I didn’t know what to suspect, especially from the word choice within the name. Once I was requested to 
  insert my age, it was then that I developed expectations of what was to come. Initially to understand what I was being shown was difficult 
  and slightly overwhelming as it was the first time that I was exposed to such a scatter plot. However, once I deactivated the diagram being 
  shown to me based on specific categories, I was able to better understand what I was meant to interpret.  It was at this point that I 
  realized that the graph turned out exactly as I had expected. Based on my age, the graph demonstrates the average age of a particular profession. 
  The added feature, however, is you can select categories that give you detailed specifics based on what you chose. For example, you can choose 
  to see the average age when various professions reach a career-high or creative zenith. </p>

<p>The graph in many ways reflects factors that Nathalie Riche demonstrates in chapter 9 of her book, ‘Data-driven storytelling’, whereby she 
  addresses communicating data to an audience. Riche highlighted the importance of data visualisations having annotations, as 
  <cite>“annotations add explanations and descriptions to introduce the graph’s context, which is important for almost any audience (Hullman et al., 2013)”</cite>
  (Riche et al., 2018:214). Before I spent some time navigating through the graph I had no idea what I was being shown or how the graph works, 
  this especially because the graph begins by zooming you into the detailed section of the data before giving you overall understanding. 
  This reflects what Riche et al assert, in that, annotations are very important in ensuring that a viewer understands what they are looking at 
  and how to interpret it. </p>

<p>In discussing audience expectations, Riche et al emphasized that <cite>“data stories are more impactful and useful when they are crafted with 
  the motivations, goals, and tasks of users in mind.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:220). I found this to be relevant in my experience of engaging 
  with the scatter plot. Currently, I am an honours student who is faced with many opportunities and goals of what I could become professionally. 
  When I plotted my age in the graph and realised that I was not far from the average age of ‘creative zenith’ for a director and writer, it spoke 
  to the personal goals and aspiration have in becoming a creative director, as well as being a blogger. This further reflects Riche et al’s 
  philosophical standpoint, in that, <cite>“people receive certain gratifications from the media they consume that help satisfy various underlying 
    social or psychological needs.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:222). The psychological need that I felt was fulfilled is that I was able to gain 
    insight into myself and whether my age aligns with my professional goals. </p>

<p>One of the communication strategies that the ‘Who old are you’ makes use of, is engagement. Through asking viewers a question, they encourage 
  engagement with the data, as well as, audience self-identification. In this case, asking for my age allowed me to better engage with the data 
  by providing an opportunity for self-identification. Besides encouraging engagement and self-identification, Riche et al establish that asking 
  the audience a question allows the audience to better remember what they have seen. For instance, I am now able to remember what average age 
  directors and writers experience a career peak and creative zenith. </p>

<p>Overall, I advance that the ‘Who old are you’ scatter plot is a great example of a well-designed data visualisation that can grab attention 
  for its audience as well offer an opportunity for self-identification. The information the communicate is relevant to all people, and speaks 
  to something that everyone at some point can identify with, or needs and wants to know. The main area of concern is the lack of annotation for 
  users first encountering the graph. Then again, it causes the user to explore the plot more in the curiosity of what it does, however, could 
  leave room for misinterpretations. With that being said, I further advance Rich et al thesis in communicating data to an audience, in that, 
  <cite>“A single-story cannot possibly address all possible different audiences and their needs. And any well-designed story will be tailored 
    not just to its data and the intended message, but to its audience.” </cite>  (Riche et al., 2018:212)</p>
