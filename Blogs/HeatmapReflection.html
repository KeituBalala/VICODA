<h1>Critical Reflection: Coronavirus Heatmap</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/10/06"> Posted Tuesday, 6 October</time>

<p>In this blog post, I will be critically reflecting on me coronavirus heatmap data visualisation, based on chapter 9 from 
  Nathalie Riche’s book <cite>‘Data-Driven Storytelling’</cite>. I will begin by analyzing and providing background to the heatmap 
  visualisation, then reflect on the communication strategies that I have implemented in the graph, as well as, highlight any limitations 
  and improvements.</p>

<p>According to daily egg, a heatmap is a data visualisation that <cite>“uses colour the way a bar graph uses height and width: as a 
  data visualization tool.”</cite> (TheDailyEgg 2020). That is to say, as a bar graph uses the height of each bar to reflect numbers, 
  in a heatmap colour is used to reflect numbers. One of the main benefits of heatmaps is that they provide a visual approach to 
  understanding the intensity of numeric values. I chose a heatmap as a data visualisation so as to better compare coronavirus data 
  between various countries in a way that would be simple for all audiences to interpret despite the level of data visualisation literacy. </p>

<p>In the chapter, Riche et al assert the importance of a data artist having an understanding of their audience’s data visualisation 
  literacy. They define visualisation literacy as <cite>“the ability to interpret visual patterns of the underlying data and to 
    confidently use visualisation to answer questions about the data.”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:214). To this end, I have made 
    use of a heatmap that makes use of shades of colours to communicate degree and levels of data to the audience in a manner that 
    is easily understandable by all. I ensured that the lower the number the lighter the colour and the higher the number the darker the circle. </p>

<p>Riche et al emphasize that it is the responsibility of the data artist to create visualisations that won’t skew or mislead the 
  audience's interpretations. One way that Riche et al suggest data artists avoid this, 
  is through the use of annotations. <cite>“Annotations add explanations and descriptions to introduce the graph’s context, which is important 
    for almost any audience (Hullman et al., 2013)”</cite> (Riche et al., 2018:214). That being said, I have made use of a short description on 
    top of the heatmap that provides a brief explanation of how the user should interpret the visualisation. Through this, the audience is 
    better guided in how to interpret and read the chart. </p>

<p>Riche et al introduce the importance of understanding the targeted audience’s design expectations. Consistency in colours, fonts, 
  and layout used in creating the visualisation is one strategy that a data artist can incorporate to ensure audience relatability and 
  return. Riche et al refer to this as <cite>“visual branding”</cite>. (Riche et al., 2018:219). To reflect the website style guide, I 
  used different shades of the colours that I identified in my website style guide. Furthermore, The same set of colours have been used 
  in both my data visualisation to achieve a form of visual branding. </p>

<p>According to Riche et al, there are four main categories of what the audience may want and their motivations for engaging with data 
  visualisations. These being; to stay informed, gain insight into oneself or others, to socially interact and connect with others, or as 
  relaxing entertainment. The motivation that I used to design my coronavirus heatmap is the desire for audiences to remain informed. 
  As borders are slowly being opened to travel again, I aimed to ensure that through my heatmap, the audience is able to compare coronavirus 
  data progress between some of the most travelled to countries including South Africa. </p>

<p>Although the layout of the heatmap achieves many of my creative objectives there are various levels of innovation that I aimed to 
  incorporate but didn’t achieve. By achieving self-identification, it possible to tailor the data visualisation to the audience without 
  knowing it. Riche et al identified one of the innovative ways to encourage self-identification, being through directly engaging the audience, 
  for example, by asking the audience questions.</p>

<p>  I aimed to increase user interactivity, as well as, make use tooltip feature so that users are able to see exact numbers when hovering 
  over a certain circle. However, due to limitations such as time and technical competence I was not able to create the data visualisation 
  to reach its full potential. In future data visualisations, I aim to make the main focus of the technical aspect interactivity. </p>
