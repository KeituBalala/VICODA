<h1>Analysis: History Of Data Visualisation</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/08/11"> Posted Tuesday, 11 August</time>

<img src="../Images/HistoricDataViz.jpg" alt="Florence Nightingale Coxcomb Chart" width="600px" height="350" style="padding-top: 5%; padding-bottom: 5%;">

<p>In this blog post, I will be analysing Florence Nightingales Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the East. 
  Nightingale was a well-known statistician, social reformer, and founder of modern nursing often referred to as 
  <cite>“the lady with the lamp”</cite> (ASA 2020). In her time, Nightingale was a manager and trainer of nurses during the 
  Crimean Wars, who pioneered data visualisation with the use of infographics. </p>

<p>In the 1850s, during the Crimean War, the soldier’s mortality rate was very high and ever-increasing. Whilst working as a 
  manager and visiting various hospitals, Nightingale found that majority of the deaths were caused by poor hospital practices (Tableau 2020). 
  It was during this period that she was inspired to research and thus, create the chart that would represent and compare the soldier’s 
  deaths caused by war and those by poor hospital hygiene. </p>

<p>Nightingale’s visualisation was in a book she called <cite>“Coxcombs”</cite> (Visually 2020), the name which later was adopted as 
  the name of the actual chart. The coxcomb chart is a diagram that is similar to a pie chart however providing an opportunity for more 
  data detail. The main difference is that with a pie chart the size of the slices represents the data, whereas, the coxcomb uses slices 
  that extend in length to represent data. On the coxcomb, the data has various layers that extend with the length of the slice. 
  Nightingales chart had a total of 12 slices, that represented the months of the year. Each slice is divided into portions that 
  represent various categories of data. For example, in Nightingales' chart, the lightly shaded areas represented total deaths, and 
  the darker shaded areas represented deaths caused by battles. (Tableau 2020). </p>

<p>Besides being the chart that helped Nightingale pioneer data visualisation, as well as, making her a role model to many in the 
  field of statistics. The coxcomb chart helped her emphasize the need for increased hospital sanitation and overall hygiene(ASA 2020). 
  Through this, she went on to save many soldier’s lives. </p>

<p>According to the World Health Organisation, <cite>“the occurrence of adverse events due to unsafe care is likely one of the 10 leading 
  causes of death and disability in the world.”</cite> (WHO 2019). Furthermore, it has been found that <cite>“134 million adverse events 
    occur in hospitals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), due to unsafe care, resulting in 2.6 million deaths.”</cite> (WHO 2019). 
    These statistics are based on 2019 findings. During the current pandemic, alongside unsafe care in rural areas, the lack of equipment 
    and capacity has resulted in many deaths. In the time of the Crimean battles, Nightingale collected data that would reflect the 
    importance of sanitation in hospitals, moreover, that visualised the relationship between cleanliness and death tolls(Tableau 2020). 
    As a result, not only was the data visualisation in itself important but so was the research and data that formed it. </p>

<p>The coxcomb chart is a suitable choice for presentation purposes, especially, to communicate to viewers who don’t have much technical 
  knowledge regarding the data. On the other hand, coxcomb charts are not ideal for representing subtle changes and differences, as these 
  are difficult to detect and represent. They are, however, ideal for demonstrating patterns present within the dataset. </p>

<p>Reflecting on Jenny Kidd’s theories of representation, I can identify, as Kidd advances, that signs and text in themselves don’t have 
  meaning rather obtain their meaning by virtue of its difference from other signs and text. That is to say, although the rising soldier’s 
  mortality was a concern, the extent of the issue was better established a defined by how the death toll of war-related incidents and 
  healthcare-related incidents were compared to each other. </p>

<p>Although having lost a sense of its aura through mass reproduction, which as explained by Benjamin Walter and asserted by Kidd, was 
  as a result of reproduced work <cite>“lacking in one element; its presence in time and space its unique existence at the place where 
    it happens to be”</cite> (Benjamin, 1955:29). The coxcomb chart still reflects the politics of representation, as it was created to 
    persuade. Kidd stated that <cite>“to say something is political is to note that it can never be neutral or a-historical, even when it 
      might appear to be ambivalent.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:37). </p>

<p>Regardless of the intention, any form of representation can be political as its open for interpretation. In the case of Nightingale, her 
  chart challenged the English healthcare system, questioning the policies and procedures that had been put in place in hospitals. In her 
  article, Sujata Gupta emphasizes that Nightingale took advantage of the power of visualising science to “convince the general public, 
  medical staff, and lawmakers that sanitation saves lives.” (Gupta 2020) </p>
