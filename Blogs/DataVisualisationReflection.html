<h1> Bonus Critical Reflection: Coronavirus Circular Packing graph</h1>

<time datetime=" 2020/10/20"> Posted Tuesday, 20 October</time>

<p>In this blog post, I will be reflecting on my circular packing graph. I make use of Jenny Kidd's 
  article <cite>'Theories of representation'</cite> as a theoretical standpoint to analyze the representation 
  strategies I have used in my graph. </p>

<p>My chosen graph is a circular packing graph. The circular packing diagram demonstrates the visualisation of a hierarchic 
  organisation. In my diagram, I aimed to demonstrate the hierarchy of coronavirus cases confirmed and of the subcategories 
  of those confirmed, how many recovered, as well as, how many resulted in deaths. I utilized the area of the circle to represent the 
  number and portion of categories. The subcategories were calculated in proportion to the total confirmed cases. In my data 
  visualisation, I aimed to elicit hope in my audience. I found that there is so much circulation of bad news and issues, that 
  have caused anxiety. I do not wish to overlook the lives of those we have lost, but aim to encourage people to recognize that being 
  infected by the virus is not an immediate death sentence and that there is hope in all the bad, there is an opportunity for survival. </p>

<p>The disadvantage of the circular packing diagram is that it is difficult for the human eye to translate area size into exact numbers 
  accurately. As a result, I have included keys that reflect the exact numbers. The keys are meant to represent a form of Annotation, 
  to assist the audience in better interpreting the graph. </p>

 <p>In her discussion regarding representation and myth, Kidd establishes that semiotics have denotative and connotative associations. 
   In my understanding, I was able to interpret that in the denotative context, the signs and codes closely reflect reality. However, 
   in the connotative context, signs, and codes reflect a reality that is based on, often subjective, perceptions. In my circular packing 
   graph, I make use of both denotative and connotative contexts that lead the user into understanding and interpreting the graph in 
   a certain way. For example, in the denotative context, I have used actual numbers of the data to calculate circle size. This so that the 
   size of each circle is a realistic representation of the data in comparison to a whole. </p>

<p>To enhance and elicit positive emotions more than negative, I made use of colour psychology to ensure that the audience interprets the 
  data visualization positively. That is to say, I made use of the green colour for recoveries which stands out more than other colours and 
  leads the user to view the data as overly positive. I then used darker colours to represent negative outcomes such as deaths. This ensures 
  that users are automatically going to register and recognize positive results more than any other. </p>

<p>My use of colour psychology demonstrates what Kidd aims to advance in stating that <cite>“visual communication can be understood as more 
  ambiguous, suggestive and open to multiple interpretations than other forms of communication.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:26). 
  Furthermore, that <cite>“it is in more subtle ways that advertising seduces us; through association, often unspoken, just hinted at, and 
    we as consumers fill in the rest.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:33), Kidd demonstrates how through minor indications in how content is presented, 
    that stimulates consumer perceptions, and thus, influences buying decisions. Representation acts as a basis for persuasion. </p>

<p>Through my use of colour as well as a suggestive quote, I was able to persuade user perception and interpretation of the coronavirus data 
  to achieve my objective of the visualization. Which is to elicit hope in users who view the visualization. Therefore, in my persuasion of 
  the audience, my data visualization has reflected itself to be somewhat political. This is further explained by Kidd as she provides clarity 
  on the political standpoint of the discussion stating that <cite>“to say something is political is to note that it can never be neutral 
    or a-historical, even when it might appear to be ambivalent.”</cite> (Kidd, 2015:37) </p>

<p>There are various limitations that I faced in creating the circular packing graph. I hoped to increase interactivity in the diagram, however, 
  was limited because of the time frame and my level of technical competency, at the time of submission. In the future, I aim to create a more 
  intricate diagram, that better reflects data and communicates the information adequately to the user. </p>
