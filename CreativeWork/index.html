    <h1>CORONA VIRUS API DATA VISUALISATION</h1>    

    <section style="max-width:700px; margin:auto;">
    <p>My goal for the website design is to achieve simplistic sophistication. To not overwhelm users, whilst attaining their attention and 
      curiosity. I hoped to ensure that navigation is also kept simple and minimal. Currently, the most exciting and eye catching part of 
      the website is the homepage and the graphs. Most of the creative and technical exploration will be demonstrated in the formation of 
      the data visualization.</p>
